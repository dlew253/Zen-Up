## Hackathon Parameters:
Sparks Joy—Virtual Hackathon
Come and join us for a joint hackathon involving teams comprised of General Assembly Seattle's immersive classes! Bring your ideas to life in just two days, and get valuable experience working in cross-functional teams, all in a virtual environment!

This hackathon's theme is SPARKS JOY! Inspired by Marie Condo's method for tidying, the goal of which is to "create a space that sparks joy." From her book, "You can also define things that spark joy as things that make you happy" which is what this hackathon is about! You can take it literally and make a tidying app, or maybe an app that helps you figure out what you haven't been using in a while, or maybe a simple app that takes a phrase and puts it out of context. Whatever app you do, the goal is that it "sparks joy" in both users and creators. 

Overall, judges will be looking for the following things by discipline:

UXDI: Is your audience engaged? Is this a useful product to your target demographic? Was the presentation convincing?
SEI: How technically complete is the project? Does the app work? Were you able to execute on the ideas from your team? 
DSI: How did you get your data? What did you do with it? How did you interface with devs and designers?

# The Typical Spiel About Building a React App:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
